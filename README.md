# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
The project aims to develop a machine learning linear regression model that predicts the medical insurance costs for patients based on various features such as age, gender, BMI, smoking status, and region using the Insurance Cost dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to develop an accurate and reliable model that can assist healthcare providers and policymakers in making informed decisions.

## About me
i am a computer science engineer specialized in data science and machine learning, I offer my services on 'Upwork' and 'Freelancer'. you can check out my profile [https://www.freelancer.com/u/jalilb9] [https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01c41cc0b08423ddb3]

## Usage:

1- Open the notebook and navigate to the project directory.
2- Run the cells in the notebook to preprocess the dataset, build the regression model, and evaluate the model's performance.
3- Finally, the model will be used to predict the medical insurance costs for new patients.

## Result:
The model got and Error Square nearly equal between train & test data (0.57 and 0.67 respectively), which means that the model is trained well, there is no overfitting, and the model can be used to predict Medical Insurance Cost accurately
