# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
The project aims to develop a machine learning linear regression model that predicts the medical insurance costs for patients based on various features such as age, gender, BMI, smoking status, and region using the Insurance Cost dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to develop an accurate and reliable model that can assist healthcare providers and policymakers in making informed decisions.

## About me

## Installation:

1- Open Google Colab in your browser and create a new notebook.
2- Clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/jaliil-9/Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction.git or upload the project folder to Google Drive and mount the drive in the notebook using the following command:
"from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')"
3- Install the required libraries using pip install or !pip install in the notebook.
4- Upload the Kaggle medical insurance cost dataset to Google Drive or use the Kaggle API to download the dataset directly in the notebook.
5- Run the project by executing the cells in the notebook.

## Usage:

1- Open the notebook and navigate to the project directory.
2- Run the cells in the notebook to preprocess the dataset, build the regression model, and evaluate the model's performance.
3- Finally, the model will be used to predict the medical insurance costs for new patients.

## Result:
The model got and Error Square nearly equal between train & test data (0.57 and 0.67 respectively), which means that the model is trained well, there is no overfitting, and the model can be used to predict Medical Insurance Cost accurately
